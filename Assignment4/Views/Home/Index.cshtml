        <h2>The Vermont Fish & Wildlife Department</h2>
        <p>The Vermont Fish & Wildlife Department maintains developed fishing access areas. These sites provide public access to waters in Vermont for shore fishing opportunities and launching of water craft. The department manages access areas with concrete or gravel ramps for launching and retrieving of boats. Additionally, there are access areas where non-motorized vessels can easily be launched. All access areas are open to hunting, trapping, fishing, and boating. Management and administration of all access areas is primarily funded through the sale of motorboat registration fees and the Sport Fish Restoration Program (SFR)</p>
